# SQIR & VOQC

<img align="right" src="logo.png">

SQIR is a **S**mall **Q**uantum **I**ntermediate **R**epresentation for quantum programs. Its intended use is as an intermediate representation in a **V**erified **O**ptimizer for **Q**uantum **C**ircuits (VOQC), but we have also used it to implement verified versions of several quantum algorithms.

We first presented SQIR and its use in VOQC in our paper [A Verified Optimizer for Quantum Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02250) at POPL 2021. 
We provide additional details of verifying SQIR programs (including QPE and Grover's) in our paper [Proving Quantum Programs Correct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01240), presented at ITP 2021. 
We describe a SQIR formalization of Shor's factoring algorithm in our draft [A Formally Certified End-to-End Implementation of Shor's Factorization Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07112).

This repository contains our Coq formalization of SQIR and VOQC as well as several verified quantum algorithms. If you are interested in running the VOQC compiler, then you should look at our OCaml library ([inQWIRE/mlvoqc](https://github.com/inQWIRE/mlvoqc)) or Python library ([inQWIRE/pyvoqc](https://github.com/inQWIRE/pyvoqc)) instead. The OCaml library is extracted from our Coq definitions and the Python library is a wrapper around the OCaml library.

If you are interested in learning more about formal verification of quantum programs in general, we recommend Robert Rand's [Verified Quantum Computing tutorial](https://rand.cs.uchicago.edu/vqc/index.html).

## Setup

To compile SQIR and VOQC, you will need [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/) and [QuantumLib](https://github.com/inQWIRE/QuantumLib) (version 1.7.0). In order to build the Shor proof, you will also need the [Coq Interval package](http://coq-interval.gforge.inria.fr/) and the [coq-euler](https://github.com/taorunz/euler) library. We strongly recommend using [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html) to install Coq and `opam switch` to manage Coq versions. We currently support Coq **versions 8.16-8.20**. If you run into errors when compiling our proofs, first check your version of Coq (`coqc -v`).

Assuming you have opam installed (following the instructions in the link above), follow the steps below to set up your environment.
```
# environment setup
opam init
eval $(opam env)

# install some version of the OCaml compiler in a switch named "voqc"
opam switch create voqc 4.13.1
eval $(opam env)

# install Coq -- this will take a while!
opam install coq

# install the QuantumLib library
opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
opam update
opam install coq-quantumlib.1.7.0

# Optional, if you want to compile the proofs in examples/shor
opam install coq-interval
opam pin coq-euler https://github.com/taorunz/euler.git
```

*Notes*:
* Depending on your system, you may need to replace 4.13.1 in the instructions above with something like "ocaml-base-compiler.4.13.1". Any recent version of OCaml should be fine.
* We require Coq version >= 8.16.
* opam error messages and warnings are typically informative, so if you run into trouble then make sure you read the console output.

## Compilation

After following the setup directions above, you can run `make` to compile the core files of SQIR, `make voqc` to compile proofs about VOQC, `make examples` to compile proofs of correctness for quantum algorithms (excluding those in examples/shor), and `make shor` to compile proofs about Shor's algorithm. Use `make all` to compile everything. 

Our proofs are resource intensive so expect `make all` to take a little while. If you have cores to spare, then you can speed things up by compiling with the `-j` flag (e.g., `make all -j8`). On a 2015 dual-core MacBook Pro running Coq version 8.15.2, compilation takes around 30 minutes.

## Using With Other Projects

To install SQIR, run 
```opam pin coq-sqir https://github.com/inQWIRE/SQIR.git```

To pull subsequent updates, run `opam install coq-sqir`. 

To import SQIR files, use 
```Require Import SQIR.FILENAME```

Quantum circuits are expressed as programs in a simple, low-level language called SQIR, a simple quantum intermediate representation, which is deeply embedded in Coq. Optimizations and other transformations are expressed as Coq functions, which are proved correct with respect to a semantics of SQIR programs. SQIR uses a semantics of matrices of complex numbers, which is the standard for quantum computation, but treats matrices symbolically in order to reason about programs that use an arbitrary number of quantum bits. SQIR's careful design and our provided automation make it possible to write and verify a broad range of optimizations in VOQC, including full-circuit transformations from cutting-edge optimizers.},
